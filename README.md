## Shelter Helper 
### Description:
#### Shelter helper is an app for dog lovers. It's useful for people who are looking to adopt a dog, and shelters that are looking to place a dog. When a user takes a dog quiz, it will result in a breed best suited to the user's personality. That breed result is stored in a database attached to the users's location. Shelters can access this data to determine which dog breeds are most popular in different cities.
